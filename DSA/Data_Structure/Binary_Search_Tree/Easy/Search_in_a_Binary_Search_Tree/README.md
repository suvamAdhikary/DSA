# Search in a Binary Search Tree

<br>

## You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer val.

## Find the node in the BST that the node's value equals val and return the subtree rooted with that node. If such a node does not exist, return null.

<br>

### Example 1:

![ex1](assets/tree1.jpeg)
```
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 2
Output: [2,1,3]
```
<br>

### Example 2:

![ex2](assets/tree2.jpeg)
```
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 5
Output: []
``` 
<br>

### Constraints:
```
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 5000].
1 <= Node.val <= 107
root is a binary search tree.
1 <= val <= 107
```
