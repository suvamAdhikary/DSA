<br>

### Example 1:

![ex1](assets/sum_tree_1.jpeg)
```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], k = 9
Output: true
```
<br>

### Example 2:

![ex2](assets/sum_tree_2.jpeg)
```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], k = 28
Output: false
``` 
<br>

### Constraints:
```
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
-104 <= Node.val <= 104
root is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.
-105 <= k <= 105
```
