# Symmetric Tree

<br>

## Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

<br>

## [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/)

<br>

### Example 1:

![ex1](assets/symtree1.jpeg)
```
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
Output: true
```
<br>

### Example 2:

![ex2](assets/symtree2.jpeg)
```
Input: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]
Output: false
``` 
<br>

### Constraints:
```
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
``` 
<br>

### Follow up: `Could you solve it both recursively and iteratively?`
