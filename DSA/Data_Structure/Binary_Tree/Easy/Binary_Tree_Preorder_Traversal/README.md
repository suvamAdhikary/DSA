<br>

## Given the root of a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

<br>

## [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-preorder-traversal/)

<br>

### Example 1:

```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
```
<br>

### Example 2:
```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```
<br>

### Example 3:
```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
``` 
<br>

### Constraints:
```
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
``` 
<br>

### Follow up: `Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?`
