<br>

### Example 1:

![example1](assets/rev1ex1.jpeg)
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
```

### Example 2:

![example2](assets/rev1ex2.jpeg)
```
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
```
<br>

### Example 3:
```
Input: head = []
Output: []
``` 
<br>

### Constraints:
```
The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000
``` 
<br>

### Follow up: `A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?`
