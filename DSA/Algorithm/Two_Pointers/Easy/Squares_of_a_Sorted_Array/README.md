# Squares of a Sorted Array

<br>

## Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

<br>

## [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/squares-of-a-sorted-array/)

<br>

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].
```
<br>

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]
``` 
<br>

### Constraints:
```
1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.
``` 
<br>

### Follow up: `Squaring each element and sorting the new array is very trivial, could you find an O(n) solution using a different approach?`
