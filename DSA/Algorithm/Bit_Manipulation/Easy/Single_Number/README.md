# Single Number

<br>

## Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

## You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

## [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```
<br>

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```
<br>

### Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
``` 
<br>

### Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
- -3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104
- Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.
